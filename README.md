# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Ariel: a developer at Leasecake. My focuses are on leading one of our software teams, full-stack web development, and accounting services. Most recently, we launched a tool to generate [ASC 842](https://leasecake.com/asc-842-what-is-it-and-what-exactly-is-changing/) accounting reports. I have a ton of interests, but most recently found myself focusing on **software testing**, **AI/ML**, and **ethics in technology**.

I am always looking to learn and grow as a developer, so please feel free to connect with me and share your thoughts on my work. You can also find my personal portfolio at https://rshaw5.github.io/.

Thanks for visiting!

## Personal Productivity

Since around 2011, I've been investigating methods to help keep my mind focused and clear in the present moment. Of the theories I've investigated, [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) has been the most impactful. I strive to have a "mind like water" so that I can give focused attention to everything I do.

## Organizational Structure ([Holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/))

I am fascinated by 

- Personal Knowledge Management ([Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/))
- 3D Printing ([FDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication#Fused_deposition_modeling), [SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography))
