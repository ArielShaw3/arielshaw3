# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Ross: a web developer at Leasecake. I work on our full-stack application in **Vue and Laravel**; with my main focus on leading a team to create accounting services. Most recently, we launched a tool to generate [ASC 842](https://leasecake.com/asc-842-what-is-it-and-what-exactly-is-changing/) accounting reports. I have a ton of interests, but most recently found myself focusing on **testing theory**, **artificial intelligence use and ethics**, and **avoiding pre-optimization** by keeping code as simple and "boring" as possible.

I am always looking to learn and grow as a developer, so please feel free to connect with me and share your thoughts on my work.

Thanks for visiting!
